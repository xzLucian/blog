# Models

`LLMs` are powerful AI tools that can interpret and generate text like humans. They're versatile enough to write content, translate languages, summarize, and answer questions without needing specialized training for each task.

In addition to text generation, many models support:

* [Tool calling](#tool-calling) - calling external tools (like databases queries or API calls) and use results in their responses.
* [Structured output](#structured-outputs) - where the model's response is constrained to follow a defined format.
* [Multimodality](#multimodal) - process and return data other than text, such as images, audio, and video.
* [Reasoning](#reasoning) - models perform multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion.

## Basic usage

Models can be utilized in two ways:

1. **With agents** - Models can be dynamically specified when creating an [agent]().
2. **Standalone** - Models can be called directly (outside of the agent loop) for tasks like text generation, classification, or extraction without the need for an agent framework.

The same model interface works in both contexts, which gives you the flexibility to start simple and scale up to more complex agent-based workflows as needed.

### Initialize a model

The easiest way to get started with a standalone model in LangChain is to use [`init_chat_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/models/#langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model) to initialize one from a chat model provider of your choice (examples below):

👉 Read the [OpenAI chat model integration docs](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/openai)

```shell
pip install -U "langchain[openai]"
```

::: code-group

  ```python [init_chat_model]
  import os
  from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

  model = init_chat_model("gpt-4.1")
  ```

  ```python [Model Class]
  import os
  from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

  os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-..."

  model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4.1")
  ```
:::

```python
response = model.invoke("Why do parrots talk?")
```

### Key methods

  * [`Invoke`](#invoke) The model takes messages as input and outputs messages after generating a complete response.

  * [`Stream`](#Stream) Invoke the model, but stream the output as it is generated in real-time.

  * [`Batch`](#Batch)Send multiple requests to a model in a batch for more efficient processing.

:::info
  In addition to chat models, LangChain provides support for other adjacent technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores. See the [integrations page](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/providers/overview) for details.

## Parameters
A chat model takes parameters that can be used to configure its behavior. The full set of supported parameters varies by model and provider, but standard ones include:

|    name     |       type        | desc                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :---------: | :---------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    model    | string `required` | The name or identifier of the specific model you want to use with a provider.                                                                                                     |
|   api_key   |      string       | The key required for authenticating with the model's provider. This is usually issued when you sign up for access to the model. Often accessed by setting an environment variable |
| temperature |      number       | Controls the randomness of the model's output. A higher number makes responses more creative; lower ones make them more deterministic.                                            |
|   timeout   |      number       | The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the model before canceling the request.                                                                                 |
| max_tokens  |      number       | Limits the total number of tokens in the response, effectively controlling how long the output can be.                                                                            |
| max_retries |      number       | The maximum number of attempts the system will make to resend a request if it fails due to issues like network timeouts or rate limits.                                           |

Using [`init_chat_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/models/#langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model), pass these parameters as inline `**kwargs`:

:::code-group
```python [Initialize using model parameters]
model = init_chat_model(
    "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
    # Kwargs passed to the model:
    temperature=0.7,
    timeout=30,
    max_tokens=1000,
)
```
:::

:::info
  Each chat model integration may have additional params used to control provider-specific functionality. For example, [`ChatOpenAI`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/ChatOpenAI/) has `use_responses_api` to dictate whether to use the OpenAI Responses or Completions API.

  To find all the parameters supported by a given chat model, head to the [chat model integrations](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat) page.
:::


## Invocation

A chat model must be invoked to generate an output. There are three primary invocation methods, each suited to different use cases.

### Invoke

The most straightforward way to call a model is to use [`invoke()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.invoke) with a single message or a list of messages.

```python Single message 
response = model.invoke("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?")
print(response)
```

A list of messages can be provided to a model to represent conversation history. Each message has a role that models use to indicate who sent the message in the conversation. See the [messages]() guide for more detail on roles, types, and content.
:::code-group
```python [Dictionary format] 
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage

conversation = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Translate: I love programming."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "J'adore la programmation."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Translate: I love building applications."}
]

response = model.invoke(conversation)
print(response)  # AIMessage("J'adore créer des applications.")
```

```python [Message objects]   
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage

conversation = [
    SystemMessage("You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."),
    HumanMessage("Translate: I love programming."),
    AIMessage("J'adore la programmation."),
    HumanMessage("Translate: I love building applications.")
]

response = model.invoke(conversation)
print(response)  # AIMessage("J'adore créer des applications.")
```
:::
### Stream

Most models can stream their output content while it is being generated. By displaying output progressively, streaming significantly improves user experience, particularly for longer responses.

Calling [`stream()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.stream) returns an iterator that yields output chunks as they are produced. You can use a loop to process each chunk in real-time:

:::code-group
  ```python [Basic text streaming]
  for chunk in model.stream("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?"):
      print(chunk.text, end="|", flush=True)
  ```

  ```python [Stream tool calls, reasoning, and other content] 
  for chunk in model.stream("What color is the sky?"):
      for block in chunk.content_blocks:
          if block["type"] == "reasoning" and (reasoning := block.get("reasoning")):
              print(f"Reasoning: {reasoning}")
          elif block["type"] == "tool_call_chunk":
              print(f"Tool call chunk: {block}")
          elif block["type"] == "text":
              print(block["text"])
          else:
              ...
  ```
:::

As opposed to [`invoke()`](#invoke), which returns a single [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) after the model has finished generating its full response, `stream()` returns multiple [`AIMessageChunk`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessageChunk) objects, each containing a portion of the output text. Importantly, each chunk in a stream is designed to be gathered into a full message via summation:

```python Construct an AIMessage 
full = None  # None | AIMessageChunk
for chunk in model.stream("What color is the sky?"):
    full = chunk if full is None else full + chunk
    print(full.text)

# The
# The sky
# The sky is
# The sky is typically
# The sky is typically blue
# ...

print(full.content_blocks)
# [{"type": "text", "text": "The sky is typically blue..."}]
```

The resulting message can be treated the same as a message that was generated with [`invoke()`](#invoke) - for example, it can be aggregated into a message history and passed back to the model as conversational context.

:::warning
  Streaming only works if all steps in the program know how to process a stream of chunks. For instance, an application that isn't streaming-capable would be one that needs to store the entire output in memory before it can be processed.
:::


**Advanced streaming topics**

:::details "Auto-streaming" chat models
  LangChain simplifies streaming from chat models by automatically enabling streaming mode in certain cases, even when you're not explicitly calling the streaming methods. This is particularly useful when you use the non-streaming invoke method but still want to stream the entire application, including intermediate results from the chat model.

  In [LangGraph agents](), for example, you can call `model.invoke()` within nodes, but LangChain will automatically delegate to streaming if running in a streaming mode.

  #### How it works

  When you `invoke()` a chat model, LangChain will automatically switch to an internal streaming mode if it detects that you are trying to stream the overall application. The result of the invocation will be the same as far as the code that was using invoke is concerned; however, while the chat model is being streamed, LangChain will take care of invoking [`on_llm_new_token`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/callbacks/#langchain_core.callbacks.base.AsyncCallbackHandler.on_llm_new_token) events in LangChain's callback system.

  Callback events allow LangGraph `stream()` and [`astream_events()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.astream_events) to surface the chat model's output in real-time.
:::


:::details Streaming events

LangChain chat models can also stream semantic events using [`astream_events()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.astream_events).

This simplifies filtering based on event types and other metadata, and will aggregate the full message in the background. See below for an example.

```python
async for event in model.astream_events("Hello"):

    if event["event"] == "on_chat_model_start":
        print(f"Input: {event['data']['input']}")

    elif event["event"] == "on_chat_model_stream":
        print(f"Token: {event['data']['chunk'].text}")

    elif event["event"] == "on_chat_model_end":
        print(f"Full message: {event['data']['output'].text}")

    else:
        pass
```

```txt
Input: Hello
Token: Hi
Token:  there
Token: !
Token:  How
Token:  can
Token:  I
...
Full message: Hi there! How can I help today?
```

See the [`astream_events()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.astream_events) reference for event types and other details.
:::

### Batch

Batching a collection of independent requests to a model can significantly improve performance and reduce costs, as the processing can be done in parallel:

```python Batch 
responses = model.batch([
    "Why do parrots have colorful feathers?",
    "How do airplanes fly?",
    "What is quantum computing?"
])
for response in responses:
    print(response)
```

This section describes a chat model method [`batch()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch), which parallelizes model calls client-side.

It is **distinct** from batch APIs supported by inference providers, such as [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch) or [Anthropic](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/batch-processing#message-batches-api).


By default, [`batch()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch) will only return the final output for the entire batch. If you want to receive the output for each individual input as it finishes generating, you can stream results with [`batch_as_completed()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch_as_completed):

```python Yield batch responses upon completion 
for response in model.batch_as_completed([
    "Why do parrots have colorful feathers?",
    "How do airplanes fly?",
    "What is quantum computing?"
]):
    print(response)
```


When using [`batch_as_completed()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch_as_completed), results may arrive out of order. Each includes the input index for matching to reconstruct the original order as needed.



When processing a large number of inputs using [`batch()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch) or [`batch_as_completed()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch_as_completed), you may want to control the maximum number of parallel calls. This can be done by setting the [`max_concurrency`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig.max_concurrency) attribute in the [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) dictionary.

```python Batch with max concurrency 
model.batch(
    list_of_inputs,
    config={
        'max_concurrency': 5,  # Limit to 5 parallel calls
    }
)
```

See the [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) reference for a full list of supported attributes.


For more details on batching, see the [reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch).

## Tool calling

Models can request to call tools that perform tasks such as fetching data from a database, searching the web, or running code. Tools are pairings of:

1. A schema, including the name of the tool, a description, and/or argument definitions (often a JSON schema)
2. A function or <Tooltip tip="A method that can suspend execution and resume at a later time">coroutine</Tooltip> to execute.

You may hear the term "function calling". We use this interchangeably with "tool calling".

To make tools that you have defined available for use by a model, you must bind them using [`bind_tools()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.bind_tools). In subsequent invocations, the model can choose to call any of the bound tools as needed.

Some model providers offer built-in tools that can be enabled via model or invocation parameters (e.g. [`ChatOpenAI`](), [`ChatAnthropic`]()). Check the respective [provider reference]() for details.

:::tip
  See the [tools guide]() for details and other options for creating tools.
:::

```python Binding user tools 
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def get_weather(location: str) -> str:
    """Get the weather at a location."""
    return f"It's sunny in {location}."


model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])  # [!code highlight]

response = model_with_tools.invoke("What's the weather like in Boston?")
for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
    # View tool calls made by the model
    print(f"Tool: {tool_call['name']}")
    print(f"Args: {tool_call['args']}")
```

When binding user-defined tools, the model's response includes a **request** to execute a tool. When using a model separately from an [agent](), it is up to you to perform the requested action and return the result back to the model for use in subsequent reasoning. Note that when using an [agent](), the agent loop will handle the tool execution loop for you.


Below, we show some common ways you can use tool calling.


:::details Tool execution loop
  When a model returns tool calls, you need to execute the tools and pass the results back to the model. This creates a conversation loop where the model can use tool results to generate its final response. LangChain includes [agent]() abstractions that handle this orchestration for you.

  Here's a simple example of how to do this:

  ```python Tool execution loop 
  # Bind (potentially multiple) tools to the model
  model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])

  # Step 1: Model generates tool calls
  messages = [{"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather in Boston?"}]
  ai_msg = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
  messages.append(ai_msg)

  # Step 2: Execute tools and collect results
  for tool_call in ai_msg.tool_calls:
      # Execute the tool with the generated arguments
      tool_result = get_weather.invoke(tool_call)
      messages.append(tool_result)

  # Step 3: Pass results back to model for final response
  final_response = model_with_tools.invoke(messages)
  print(final_response.text)
  # "The current weather in Boston is 72°F and sunny."
  ```

  Each [`ToolMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolMessage) returned by the tool includes a `tool_call_id` that matches the original tool call, helping the model correlate results with requests.
:::

:::details Forcing tool calls
  By default, the model has the freedom to choose which bound tool to use based on the user's input. However, you might want to force choosing a tool, ensuring the model uses either a particular tool or **any** tool from a given list:

  :::code-group
  ```python [Force use of any tool]
  model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool_1], tool_choice="any")
  ```

  ```python [Force use of specific tools]
  model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool_1], tool_choice="tool_1")
  ```
:::


:::details Parallel tool calls
  Many models support calling multiple tools in parallel when appropriate. This allows the model to gather information from different sources simultaneously.

  ```python Parallel tool calls 
  model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([get_weather])

  response = model_with_tools.invoke(
      "What's the weather in Boston and Tokyo?"
  )


  # The model may generate multiple tool calls
  print(response.tool_calls)
  # [
  #   {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'Boston'}, 'id': 'call_1'},
  #   {'name': 'get_weather', 'args': {'location': 'Tokyo'}, 'id': 'call_2'},
  # ]


  # Execute all tools (can be done in parallel with async)
  results = []
  for tool_call in response.tool_calls:
      if tool_call['name'] == 'get_weather':
          result = get_weather.invoke(tool_call)
      ...
      results.append(result)
  ```

  The model intelligently determines when parallel execution is appropriate based on the independence of the requested operations.

  :::tip
  Most models supporting tool calling enable parallel tool calls by default. Some (including [OpenAI]() and [Anthropic]()) allow you to disable this feature. To do this, set `parallel_tool_calls=False`:

  ```python  
  model.bind_tools([get_weather], parallel_tool_calls=False)
  ```
:::

:::details Streaming tool calls
  When streaming responses, tool calls are progressively built through [`ToolCallChunk`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.ToolCallChunk). This allows you to see tool calls as they're being generated rather than waiting for the complete response.

  ```python Streaming tool calls 
  for chunk in model_with_tools.stream(
      "What's the weather in Boston and Tokyo?"
  ):
      # Tool call chunks arrive progressively
      for tool_chunk in chunk.tool_call_chunks:
          if name := tool_chunk.get("name"):
              print(f"Tool: {name}")
          if id_ := tool_chunk.get("id"):
              print(f"ID: {id_}")
          if args := tool_chunk.get("args"):
              print(f"Args: {args}")

  # Output:
  # Tool: get_weather
  # ID: call_SvMlU1TVIZugrFLckFE2ceRE
  # Args: {"lo
  # Args: catio
  # Args: n": "B
  # Args: osto
  # Args: n"}
  # Tool: get_weather
  # ID: call_QMZdy6qInx13oWKE7KhuhOLR
  # Args: {"lo
  # Args: catio
  # Args: n": "T
  # Args: okyo
  # Args: "}
  ```

  You can accumulate chunks to build complete tool calls:

  ```python Accumulate tool calls 
  gathered = None
  for chunk in model_with_tools.stream("What's the weather in Boston?"):
      gathered = chunk if gathered is None else gathered + chunk
      print(gathered.tool_calls)
  ```
:::

## Structured outputs

Models can be requested to provide their response in a format matching a given schema. This is useful for ensuring the output can be easily parsed and used in subsequent processing. LangChain supports multiple schema types and methods for enforcing structured outputs.

**Pydantic**

  [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/concepts/models/#basic-model-usage) provide the richest feature set with field validation, descriptions, and nested structures.

  ```python  
  from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

  class Movie(BaseModel):
      """A movie with details."""
      title: str = Field(..., description="The title of the movie")
      year: int = Field(..., description="The year the movie was released")
      director: str = Field(..., description="The director of the movie")
      rating: float = Field(..., description="The movie's rating out of 10")

  model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(Movie)
  response = model_with_structure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception")
  print(response)  # Movie(title="Inception", year=2010, director="Christopher Nolan", rating=8.8)
  ```

**TypedDict**

  `TypedDict` provides a simpler alternative using Python's built-in typing, ideal when you don't need runtime validation.

  ```python  
  from typing_extensions import TypedDict, Annotated

  class MovieDict(TypedDict):
      """A movie with details."""
      title: Annotated[str, ..., "The title of the movie"]
      year: Annotated[int, ..., "The year the movie was released"]
      director: Annotated[str, ..., "The director of the movie"]
      rating: Annotated[float, ..., "The movie's rating out of 10"]

  model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(MovieDict)
  response = model_with_structure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception")
  print(response)  # {'title': 'Inception', 'year': 2010, 'director': 'Christopher Nolan', 'rating': 8.8}
  ```

**JSON Schema**

For maximum control or interoperability, you can provide a raw JSON Schema.

```python  
import json

json_schema = {
    "title": "Movie",
    "description": "A movie with details",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "title": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The title of the movie"
        },
        "year": {
            "type": "integer",
            "description": "The year the movie was released"
        },
        "director": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The director of the movie"
        },
        "rating": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "The movie's rating out of 10"
        }
    },
    "required": ["title", "year", "director", "rating"]
}

model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(
    json_schema,
    method="json_schema",
)
response = model_with_structure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception")
print(response)  # {'title': 'Inception', 'year': 2010, ...}
```
:::tip
**Key considerations for structured outputs:**

* **Method parameter**: Some providers support different methods (`'json_schema'`, `'function_calling'`, `'json_mode'`)
  * `'json_schema'` typically refers to dedicated structured output features offered by a provider
  * `'function_calling'` derives structured output by forcing a [tool call](#tool-calling) following the given schema
  * `'json_mode'` is a precursor to `'json_schema'` offered by some providers- it generates valid json, but the schema must be described in the prompt
* **Include raw**: Use `include_raw=True` to get both the parsed output and the raw AI message
* **Validation**: Pydantic models provide automatic validation, while `TypedDict` and JSON Schema require manual validation
:::

:::details Example: Message output alongside parsed structure
It can be useful to return the raw [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) object alongside the parsed representation to access response metadata such as [token counts](#token-usage). To do this, set [`include_raw=True`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.with_structured_output\(include_raw\)) when calling [`with_structured_output`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.with_structured_output):

```python  
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class Movie(BaseModel):
    """A movie with details."""
    title: str = Field(..., description="The title of the movie")
    year: int = Field(..., description="The year the movie was released")
    director: str = Field(..., description="The director of the movie")
    rating: float = Field(..., description="The movie's rating out of 10")

model_with_structure = model.with_structured_output(Movie, include_raw=True)  # [!code highlight]
response = model_with_structure.invoke("Provide details about the movie Inception")
response
# {
#     "raw": AIMessage(...),
#     "parsed": Movie(title=..., year=..., ...),
#     "parsing_error": None,
# }
```

:::details Example: Nested structures
Schemas can be nested:

  :::code-group

  ```python [Pydantic BaseModel]
  from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

  class Actor(BaseModel):
      name: str
      role: str

  class MovieDetails(BaseModel):

## Advanced topics

### Multimodal

Certain models can process and return non-textual data such as images, audio, and video. You can pass non-textual data to a model by providing [content blocks]().

:::tip
  All LangChain chat models with underlying multimodal capabilities support:

  1. Data in the cross-provider standard format (see [our messages guide]())
  2. OpenAI [chat completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) format
  3. Any format that is native to that specific provider (e.g., Anthropic models accept Anthropic native format)
:::

See the [multimodal section]() of the messages guide for details.

Some models can return multimodal data as part of their response. If invoked to do so, the resulting [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) will have content blocks with multimodal types.

```python Multimodal output 
response = model.invoke("Create a picture of a cat")
print(response.content_blocks)
# [
#     {"type": "text", "text": "Here's a picture of a cat"},
#     {"type": "image", "base64": "...", "mime_type": "image/jpeg"},
# ]
```

See the [integrations page]() for details on specific providers.

### Reasoning

Newer models are capable of performing multi-step reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. This involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps.

**If supported by the underlying model,** you can surface this reasoning process to better understand how the model arrived at its final answer.

:::code-group
  ```python [Stream reasoning output]
  for chunk in model.stream("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?"):
      reasoning_steps = [r for r in chunk.content_blocks if r["type"] == "reasoning"]
      print(reasoning_steps if reasoning_steps else chunk.text)
  ```

  ```python [Complete reasoning output]
  response = model.invoke("Why do parrots have colorful feathers?")
  reasoning_steps = [b for b in response.content_blocks if b["type"] == "reasoning"]
  print(" ".join(step["reasoning"] for step in reasoning_steps))
  ```
:::

Depending on the model, you can sometimes specify the level of effort it should put into reasoning. Similarly, you can request that the model turn off reasoning entirely. This may take the form of categorical "tiers" of reasoning (e.g., `'low'` or `'high'`) or integer token budgets.

For details, see the [integrations page]() or [reference](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/) for your respective chat model.

### Local models

LangChain supports running models locally on your own hardware. This is useful for scenarios where either data privacy is critical, you want to invoke a custom model, or when you want to avoid the costs incurred when using a cloud-based model.

[Ollama]() is one of the easiest ways to run models locally. See the full list of local integrations on the [integrations page]().

### Prompt caching

Many providers offer prompt caching features to reduce latency and cost on repeat processing of the same tokens. These features can be **implicit** or **explicit**:

* **Implicit prompt caching:** providers will automatically pass on cost savings if a request hits a cache. Examples: [OpenAI]() and [Gemini]() (Gemini 2.5 and above).
* **Explicit caching:** providers allow you to manually indicate cache points for greater control or to guarantee cost savings. Examples: [`ChatOpenAI`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/integrations/langchain_openai/ChatOpenAI/) (via `prompt_cache_key`), Anthropic's [`AnthropicPromptCachingMiddleware`]() and [`cache_control`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/anthropic#prompt-caching) options, [AWS Bedrock](), [Gemini](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/google_genai/chat_models/langchain_google_genai.chat_models.ChatGoogleGenerativeAI.html).

:::warning
  Prompt caching is often only engaged above a minimum input token threshold. See [provider pages]() for details.
:::

Cache usage will be reflected in the [usage metadata]() of the model response.

### Server-side tool use

Some providers support server-side [tool-calling](#tool-calling) loops: models can interact with web search, code interpreters, and other tools and analyze the results in a single conversational turn.

If a model invokes a tool server-side, the content of the response message will include content representing the invocation and result of the tool. Accessing the [content blocks]() of the response will return the server-side tool calls and results in a provider-agnostic format:

**Invoke with server-side tool use**

```python 
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

model = init_chat_model("gpt-4.1-mini")

tool = {"type": "web_search"}
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([tool])

response = model_with_tools.invoke("What was a positive news story from today?")
response.content_blocks
```
**Result expandable**

```python 
[
    {
        "type": "server_tool_call",
        "name": "web_search",
        "args": {
            "query": "positive news stories today",
            "type": "search"
        },
        "id": "ws_abc123"
    },
    {
        "type": "server_tool_result",
        "tool_call_id": "ws_abc123",
        "status": "success"
    },
    {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Here are some positive news stories from today...",
        "annotations": [
            {
                "end_index": 410,
                "start_index": 337,
                "title": "article title",
                "type": "citation",
                "url": "..."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

This represents a single conversational turn; there are no associated [ToolMessage]() objects that need to be passed in as in client-side [tool-calling](#tool-calling).

See the [integration page]() for your given provider for available tools and usage details.

### Rate limiting

Many chat model providers impose a limit on the number of invocations that can be made in a given time period. If you hit a rate limit, you will typically receive a rate limit error response from the provider, and will need to wait before making more requests.

To help manage rate limits, chat model integrations accept a `rate_limiter` parameter that can be provided during initialization to control the rate at which requests are made.

:::details Initialize and use a rate limiter
  LangChain in comes with (an optional) built-in [`InMemoryRateLimiter`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/rate_limiters/#langchain_core.rate_limiters.InMemoryRateLimiter). This limiter is thread safe and can be shared by multiple threads in the same process.

  ```python Define a rate limiter 
  from langchain_core.rate_limiters import InMemoryRateLimiter

  rate_limiter = InMemoryRateLimiter(
      requests_per_second=0.1,  # 1 request every 10s
      check_every_n_seconds=0.1,  # Check every 100ms whether allowed to make a request
      max_bucket_size=10,  # Controls the maximum burst size.
  )

  model = init_chat_model(
      model="gpt-5",
      model_provider="openai",
      rate_limiter=rate_limiter  # [!code highlight]
  )
  ```

:::warning
  The provided rate limiter can only limit the number of requests per unit time. It will not help if you need to also limit based on the size of the requests.

:::
### Base URL or proxy

For many chat model integrations, you can configure the base URL for API requests, which allows you to use model providers that have OpenAI-compatible APIs or to use a proxy server.

:::details Base URL
Many model providers offer OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., [Together AI](https://www.together.ai/), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)). You can use [`init_chat_model`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/models/#langchain.chat_models.init_chat_model) with these providers by specifying the appropriate `base_url` parameter:

```python
model = init_chat_model(
    model="MODEL_NAME",
    model_provider="openai",
    base_url="BASE_URL",
    api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
)
```

When using direct chat model class instantiation, the parameter name may vary by provider. Check the respective [reference]() for details.
:::

:::details Proxy configuration
For deployments requiring HTTP proxies, some model integrations support proxy configuration:

```python  
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4o",
    openai_proxy="http://proxy.example.com:8080"
)
```
Proxy support varies by integration. Check the specific model provider's [reference]() for proxy configuration options.
:::

### Log probabilities

Certain models can be configured to return token-level log probabilities representing the likelihood of a given token by setting the `logprobs` parameter when initializing the model:

```python  
model = init_chat_model(
    model="gpt-4o",
    model_provider="openai"
).bind(logprobs=True)

response = model.invoke("Why do parrots talk?")
print(response.response_metadata["logprobs"])
```

### Token usage

A number of model providers return token usage information as part of the invocation response. When available, this information will be included on the [`AIMessage`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain/messages/#langchain.messages.AIMessage) objects produced by the corresponding model. For more details, see the [messages]() guide.

:::tip
Some provider APIs, notably OpenAI and Azure OpenAI chat completions, require users opt-in to receiving token usage data in streaming contexts. See the [streaming usage metadata]() section of the integration guide for details.
:::

You can track aggregate token counts across models in an application using either a callback or context manager, as shown below:

:::code-group

  ```python [Callback handler]
  from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
  from langchain_core.callbacks import UsageMetadataCallbackHandler

  model_1 = init_chat_model(model="gpt-4o-mini")
  model_2 = init_chat_model(model="claude-haiku-4-5-20251001")

  callback = UsageMetadataCallbackHandler()
  result_1 = model_1.invoke("Hello", config={"callbacks": [callback]})
  result_2 = model_2.invoke("Hello", config={"callbacks": [callback]})
  callback.usage_metadata
  ```

  ```python [Context manager]
  from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model
  from langchain_core.callbacks import get_usage_metadata_callback

  model_1 = init_chat_model(model="gpt-4o-mini")
  model_2 = init_chat_model(model="claude-haiku-4-5-20251001")

  with get_usage_metadata_callback() as cb:
      model_1.invoke("Hello")
      model_2.invoke("Hello")
      print(cb.usage_metadata)
  ```
:::

```python  
{
    'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18': {
        'input_tokens': 8,
        'output_tokens': 10,
        'total_tokens': 18,
        'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0},
        'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}
    },
    'claude-haiku-4-5-20251001': {
        'input_tokens': 8,
        'output_tokens': 21,
        'total_tokens': 29,
        'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0, 'cache_creation': 0}
    }
}
```

### Invocation config

When invoking a model, you can pass additional configuration through the `config` parameter using a [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) dictionary. This provides run-time control over execution behavior, callbacks, and metadata tracking.

Common configuration options include:

```python Invocation with config 
response = model.invoke(
    "Tell me a joke",
    config={
        "run_name": "joke_generation",      # Custom name for this run
        "tags": ["humor", "demo"],          # Tags for categorization
        "metadata": {"user_id": "123"},     # Custom metadata
        "callbacks": [my_callback_handler], # Callback handlers
    }
)
```

These configuration values are particularly useful when:

* Debugging with [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) tracing
* Implementing custom logging or monitoring
* Controlling resource usage in production
* Tracking invocations across complex pipelines

:::details Key configuration attributes
| name       |      type      |  desc |
| ------------- | :-----------: | :----: |
| run_name      | string | Identifies this specific invocation in logs and traces. Not inherited by sub-calls.|
| tags      |   string[]    |  Labels inherited by all sub-calls for filtering and organization in debugging tools. |
| metadata |   object    |  Custom key-value pairs for tracking additional context, inherited by all sub-calls.|
|max_concurrency|number|Controls the maximum number of parallel calls when using [`batch()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch) or [`batch_as_completed()`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.batch_as_completed).|
|callbacks| array|Handlers for monitoring and responding to events during execution.|
|recursion_limit|number|Maximum recursion depth for chains to prevent infinite loops in complex pipelines.|

See full [`RunnableConfig`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/runnables/#langchain_core.runnables.RunnableConfig) reference for all supported attributes.
:::

### Configurable models

You can also create a runtime-configurable model by specifying [`configurable_fields`](https://reference.langchain.com/python/langchain_core/language_models/#langchain_core.language_models.chat_models.BaseChatModel.configurable_fields). If you don't specify a model value, then `'model'` and `'model_provider'` will be configurable by default.

```python 
from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model

configurable_model = init_chat_model(temperature=0)

configurable_model.invoke(
    "what's your name",
    config={"configurable": {"model": "gpt-5-nano"}},  # Run with GPT-5-Nano
)
configurable_model.invoke(
    "what's your name",
    config={"configurable": {"model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"}},  # Run with Claude
)
```

:::details Configurable model with default values
We can create a configurable model with default model values, specify which parameters are configurable, and add prefixes to configurable params:

```python  
first_model = init_chat_model(
        model="gpt-4.1-mini",
        temperature=0,
        configurable_fields=("model", "model_provider", "temperature", "max_tokens"),
        config_prefix="first",  # Useful when you have a chain with multiple models
)

first_model.invoke("what's your name")
```

```python  
first_model.invoke(
    "what's your name",
    config={
        "configurable": {
            "first_model": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
            "first_temperature": 0.5,
            "first_max_tokens": 100,
        }
    },
)
```
:::

:::details Using a configurable model declaratively
We can call declarative operations like `bind_tools`, `with_structured_output`, `with_configurable`, etc. on a configurable model and chain a configurable model in the same way that we would a regularly instantiated chat model object.

```python  
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


class GetWeather(BaseModel):
    """Get the current weather in a given location"""

        location: str = Field(..., description="The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA")


class GetPopulation(BaseModel):
    """Get the current population in a given location"""

        location: str = Field(..., description="The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA")


model = init_chat_model(temperature=0)
model_with_tools = model.bind_tools([GetWeather, GetPopulation])

model_with_tools.invoke(
    "what's bigger in 2024 LA or NYC", config={"configurable": {"model": "gpt-4.1-mini"}}
).tool_calls
```
